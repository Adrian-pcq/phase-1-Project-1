# phase-1-Project-1

This project it's a list of our favorites superheroes from MCU.

On it we can see a menu on the left side of the page and when we clicked it apears an amplified picture on the center of the screen
with some features as name, superhero's name, homtown and skills.

It has a keydown "Delete" button for delete a hero from the menu, and a "Submit" button for create a new superhero.

If you don't want to delete a hero that you already selected you have to click it again.
